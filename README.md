BikrSwap is the first swap protocol developed to provide liquidity to the BRC-20&LTC-20&ORC-20&DRC-20 ecosystem based on the Ordinal protocol.
BikrSwap is dedicated to solving the lack of liquidity in BRC-20&LTC-20&ORC-20&DRC-20 by increasing the liquidity pool for LP transactions and enabling real-time trading. Also, to reduce the complexity of BRC-20&LTC-20&ORC-20&DRC-20 token trading and enable users to buy, sell and add liquidity pools more easily, BikrSwap attempts to bring the BTC network to the use of the LP model for the first time, allowing for more diversified use of BTC assets.
Have Fun!
